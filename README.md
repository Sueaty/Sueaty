<b>¡Hola!</b> I'm Sue an undergraduate studying computer science in Korea.<br>
It hasn't been long but I am studying with passion to pursue my career as an <b>iOS developer</b>. <br>
Participating as a 'camper' in a 6 months long ios developer track module coordinated by Naver Connect Foundation was definitely a turning point in my life.
Building communities is one of my interests and I hope to become a game changer in this field.
